## Introduction

Brussels sprouts have long been a staple for healthy, hearty meals, and with their slightly nutty and earthy flavor, they can be a delightful addition to any dish. However, to truly appreciate their unique taste, pairing Brussels sprouts with the right accompaniments is key. Whether you're trying to elevate a simple weeknight dinner or impress guests at a holiday gathering, knowing what foods complement Brussels sprouts can make all the difference. Here are five delicious pairings that will bring out the best in this humble vegetable.

## **Crispy Bacon**

Adding **crispy bacon** to Brussels sprouts is a classic combination that never disappoints. The savory, smoky flavor of bacon pairs excellently with the subtle bitterness of the sprouts. Whether you decide to scatter crumbled bacon bits on top or mix cooked strips among roasted Brussels sprouts, this duo is sure to be a hit. To enhance the pairing, consider adding a touch of balsamic glaze or a sprinkle of brown sugar for a sweet and savory finish.

## **Parmesan Cheese**

If you're looking for a way to incorporate dairy with your Brussels sprouts, **Parmesan cheese** is a great option. Its sharp and salty profile complements the earthy tones of the sprouts beautifully. Try sprinkling grated Parmesan over roasted Brussels sprouts or mixing it into a creamy sauce to toss with them. Parmesan also adds a delightful crispy texture when melted under the broiler, creating a golden crust that's hard to resist.

## **Walnuts**

**Walnuts** bring a rich, nutty flavor and satisfying crunch to Brussels sprouts dishes. Not only do they offer a contrasting texture, but they also enhance the nutritional value of your meal. For an easy and tasty side, roast Brussels sprouts and walnuts together with olive oil, garlic, and sea salt. The natural oils in the walnuts infuse the sprouts during cooking, resulting in a harmonious blend of flavors that will excite your taste buds.

## **Apples**

Pairing Brussels sprouts with **apples** may not be the most obvious choice, but it’s a match made in culinary heaven. The sweet, juicy nature of apples balances the slight bitterness of the sprouts. Whether you decide to roast them together or create a refreshing apple and Brussels sprout salad, the combination gives a wonderful contrast and brightness. Honeycrisp or Granny Smith apples work particularly well due to their firm texture and sweet-tart flavor.

## **Maple Syrup**

Adding a touch of **maple syrup** to your Brussels sprouts can transform them into a delightful side dish or main course. The sweetness of the syrup complements the sprouts' natural flavors and adds an irresistible caramelized surface when roasted. Mix Brussels sprouts with a small amount of olive oil and maple syrup before roasting, and finish with a sprinkle of sea salt and cracked pepper for a simple yet sophisticated dish. The result is a mouthwatering blend of sweet and savory that's perfect for both everyday meals and special occasions.

## Bonus: Beverage Pairing — Chardonnay

To take your Brussels sprouts meal to the next level, consider pairing it with a chilled glass of **Chardonnay**. The bright acidity and the subtle oak and fruit notes in Chardonnay align beautifully with both the bitterness of the sprouts and the smokiness of bacon or the sweetness of maple syrup. A lightly oaked Chardonnay can bring out the richness in Brussels sprouts dishes without overwhelming their delicate flavors, offering a balanced and refined dining experience.
