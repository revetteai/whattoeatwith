Turkey is more than just a holiday staple; it's a versatile protein that can be enjoyed year-round and in various culinary contexts. Whether you're diving into a juicy roast or savoring slices of deli-style cold cuts, pairing turkey with complementary dishes can elevate your meal experience from ordinary to extraordinary. So, what should you serve with turkey to make the most out of its delightful taste?

## **1. Cranberry Sauce**

Cranberry sauce is often seen as turkey's classic companion, especially during holiday seasons. The **tartness and sweetness** of cranberries provide a vibrant contrast to turkey's rich flavor, while the sauce’s acidity helps balance out the meat's natural oils. This pairing is a match made in culinary heaven, offering a burst of flavor with every bite. Plus, its festive hue adds a lovely pop of color to your plate!

## **2. Mashed Potatoes**

Few things scream comfort food like **creamy mashed potatoes** alongside turkey. The smooth texture and buttery taste of mashed potatoes enhance the savory profile of turkey, creating a hearty and satisfying meal. The softness of the potatoes acts as a comforting counterpoint to turkey's firmer texture, and when drizzled with a rich gravy, this pairing becomes irresistibly delectable. Whether whipped with cream or garnished with chives, mashed potatoes are a sure win.

## **3. Brussels Sprouts**

If you’re looking for something green to accompany your turkey, **roasted Brussels sprouts** are an excellent choice. Their **earthy flavor** and slightly bitter edge marry well with turkey, especially when dressed with a drizzle of balsamic vinegar or a sprinkle of crispy bacon bits. These miniature cabbages add a bit of crunch and freshness, making your meal both nutritious and satisfying. Plus, roasting brings out their natural sweetness, elevating the overall taste experience.

## **4. Stuffing**

Stuffing is another traditional turkey pairing and for good reason. The combination of herbs, bread, and vegetables in stuffing makes it a **flavor-packed companion** to turkey. Whether it's a classic bread-based stuffing or a more adventurous mix with nuts and dried fruits, this side dish provides a delightful texture contrast. The savory herbs such as sage, thyme, and rosemary complement the turkey's mild flavor, enhancing the overall aromatic profile of your meal.

## **5. Green Beans Almondine**

For a lighter option, try serving turkey with **green beans almondine**. This French side dish features sautéed green beans tossed with sliced almonds and a hint of lemon. The **crunchy almonds** provide a textural contrast to the tender turkey, while the lemon adds a fresh zestiness that can cut through the richness of the meat. It's a sophisticated yet simple pairing that appeals to both the eyes and the palate, adding a touch of elegance to any turkey meal.

## **Bonus: Wine Pairing**

For a beverage that complements turkey, consider a **Pinot Noir**. This red wine is known for its light to medium body and a smooth, fruity profile that doesn’t overpower the turkey. The bright berry flavors and subtle earthiness of Pinot Noir play beautifully with turkey’s savory notes, making it a versatile choice whether your turkey is roasted, grilled, or smoked. Plus, its well-balanced acidity helps cleanse the palate between bites, enhancing the meal's overall enjoyment.

As you explore the delightful world of turkey pairings, remember that the best sides can transform your dining experience into something truly special.
