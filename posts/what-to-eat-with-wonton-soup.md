Wonton soup is a beloved staple in many Asian cuisines, known for its delicate dumplings, flavorful broth, and soothing warmth.

Whether you're hosting a dinner or simply looking to enhance your lunch routine, understanding what to eat with wonton soup can transform it into a memorable feast. In this post, weâ€™ll explore some delightful pairings that will complement wonton soup perfectly.

## **Steamed Vegetables**

**Steamed vegetables** are a light and nutritious complement to wonton soup. Opt for a medley of broccoli, carrots, and bok choy to add a dash of color and an array of vitamins to your meal. The crisp texture and mild flavors of steamed vegetables balance the rich broth of the soup. You can season them lightly with soy sauce or ginger for an added zing. Pairing wonton soup with steamed vegetables not only boosts nutritional content but also enhances the overall palate appeal.

## **Spring Rolls**

**Spring rolls** are an appetizer that pairs perfectly with wonton soup. Their crisp exterior and savory filling provide a satisfying crunch and protein boost to your meal. Whether you choose shrimp, chicken, or a vegetarian version, the fresh herbs and spices inside the rolls juxtapose beautifully with the warmth of the soup. Dipping spring rolls in sweet chili sauce or soy sauce enhances the flavor profile, making your dining experience more dynamic.

## **Fried Rice**

Adding a side of **fried rice** can turn your wonton soup into a more substantial meal. Opt for traditional egg fried rice or go for varieties like chicken, shrimp, or vegetable fried rice. The savory, garlic-infused flavors of fried rice complement the delicate taste of wontons beautifully. Plus, rice offers an additional textural element, making it a hearty addition that pairs well with the broth. Fried rice provides a nice contrast to the smooth, tender dumplings, offering a balanced bite.

## **Dim Sum**

A **dim sum** platter, consisting of an assortment of small, savory dishes, is an excellent companion to wonton soup. With options like dumplings, buns, and rolls, a dim sum selection can cater to varying taste preferences. The bite-sized parcels, much like wontons, pack a punch with diverse fillings such as pork, shrimp, or mushrooms. This variety introduces an element of surprise and diversity, perfect for those who enjoy a tasting experience alongside their soup.

## **Pickled Vegetables**

For a tangy contrast to the warm, savory flavors of wonton soup, try adding a side of **pickled vegetables**. Pickled cucumbers, radishes, or cabbage introduce an acidic counterbalance that enlivens the taste buds. The sharpness of pickles cleanses the palate between bites, enhancing the soothing experience of drinking the broth. They are light, crunchy, and perfectly suited for those who prefer a flavorful contrast without additional heaviness.

## **Bonus: Jasmine Tea**

For a refreshing beverage pairing with wonton soup, consider a pot of **jasmine tea**. The floral notes and delicate aroma of jasmine tea cleanse the palate and provide a mild sweetness that complements the savory notes of the soup. Jasmine tea's soothing qualities enhance the comforting aspects of wonton soup, making it an ideal accompaniment for a relaxing meal.
