When it comes to seafood, **calamari** often stands out as a versatile dish that can be enjoyed in many forms—from crispy fried rings to tender grilled pieces. Pairing calamari with the right side or complementing flavor can elevate your dining experience, making it memorable and delightful. Whether you're hosting a dinner party or simply treating yourself to a gourmet meal, knowing what to eat with calamari helps blend flavors, balance textures, and even hint at cultural cuisines. Here are some perfect accompaniments to pair with your next plate of calamari.

## 1. **Garlic Aioli**

A classic choice for fried calamari, **garlic aioli** brings out the mild flavors of the squid while adding a creamy and tangy zest. This garlic-infused mayonnaise-like dip is not only simple to prepare but also acts as a perfect complementary flavor to the slight chewiness of calamari. The richness of the aioli balances the crispy texture of fried calamari beautifully, making each bite a delightful harmony of tastes and sensations.

## 2. **Arugula Salad**

For those looking to keep it light, pairing calamari with a fresh **arugula salad** offers a nutritious and vibrant option. The peppery notes of arugula combine wonderfully with the soft and mild flavors of calamari. A simple dressing made from lemon juice and olive oil can enhance the dish, while cherry tomatoes and shaved parmesan give an extra layer of taste and texture. This combination is not only healthy but also visually appealing, giving your plate a burst of color.

## 3. **Lemon Risotto**

Classic and indulgent, **lemon risotto** is an exceptional partner to calamari. The creamy richness of risotto finds balance in the subtle, ocean-inspired taste of the squid. Additionally, the citrus from the lemon accentuates calamari’s freshness without overpowering it. The creaminess from the arborio rice matches the tenderness of calamari, ensuring a luxurious mouthfeel with each spoonful.

## 4. **Broccolini**

A slightly unexpected choice, **broccolini**, provides a slightly bitter contrast that works wonders with calamari's sweet, delicate taste. When sautéed in garlic and olive oil, broccolini turns into a perfect side dish that cuts through any greasiness, particularly when calamari is served fried. This combination not only brings balance to the plate but also enhances the overall nutritional value of the meal.

## 5. **Garlic and Herb Bread**

Boost your calamari dish with some **garlic and herb bread** for a savory, hearty addition. The aromatic flavors of garlic and herbs can enhance and round out the taste profile of calamari. Perfect for soaking up any extra sauce or aioli on your plate, this bread can transform your meal into a more substantial feast that leaves everyone completely satisfied.

## Bonus: **Refreshing White Wine**

To complement your calamari, consider a crisp, **refreshing white wine** like a Sauvignon Blanc or a Pinot Grigio. These wines boast citrus and herbal notes that beautifully highlight the natural sweetness of the squid. The acidity in the wine can help cut through any richness from cooking oils or sauces, offering a clean finish on your palate. Plus, the refreshing nature of these wines provides a light and uplifting counterpart to the savory elements of your meal.
