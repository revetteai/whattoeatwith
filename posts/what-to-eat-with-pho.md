Pho is a beloved Vietnamese dish known for its aromatic broth, tender noodles, and succulent meats. But while Pho is delightful on its own, pairing it with the right side dish can elevate your dining experience to new heights. Whether you're looking to balance its rich flavors or simply want to expand your palate, here are some perfect choices for enhancing your Pho enjoyment.

## **Vietnamese Egg Rolls (Cha Gio)**

**Vietnamese Egg Rolls,** or **Cha Gio**, are a tasty accompaniment to your Pho. These crispy treats are typically filled with a scrumptious mixture of ground pork, vegetables, and clear vermicelli noodles. Their crunchy exterior and savory filling provide a delightful contrast to the silky noodles and warm broth of Pho. Perfect for dipping in a tangy fish sauce, they add an extra layer of flavor to each bite.

## **Fresh Spring Rolls (Goi Cuon)**

For a lighter option, **Fresh Spring Rolls** are an excellent choice. These vibrant rolls are packed with fresh herbs, shrimp, and vermicelli and wrapped in delicate rice paper. Their refreshing taste offers a clean and fresh counterpoint to the rich, hot broth of Pho. To enhance the experience, try dipping them in a peanut sauce that complements the aromatic notes in your bowl.

## **Banh Mi Sandwich**

The **Banh Mi Sandwich** is another wonderful pairing with Pho, providing a more filling addition to your meal. This sandwich combines crusty French baguette with savory meats, pickled vegetables, and herbs, creating a symphony of textures and flavors. The tanginess and spice of the vegetables harmonize beautifully with the savory and umami notes in Pho, making them a perfect match for those who love bold flavors.

## **Pickled Vegetables**

Pickled Vegetables are a simple, yet effective sidekick to your Pho. Their tart and tangy flavors help cut through the richness of the broth, while their crunch adds an interesting textural element. Popular pickled vegetables include daikon, carrots, and cabbage. These not only introduce a refreshing zing but also aid in digestion, providing both balance and a healthful touch to your meal.

## **Savory Pancakes (Banh Xeo)**

**Banh Xeo**, or Vietnamese savory pancakes, offer a delightful twist to the traditional Pho pairings. Made from rice flour and turmeric, these crispy pancakes are typically stuffed with shrimp, pork, and bean sprouts. Their crispiness adds a playful texture contrast to the smooth Pho noodles, while their subtly sweet and savory flavors are sealed perfectly with a side of spicy sauce, enhancing the Pho's aromatic profile.

## Bonus: Beverage Pairing with Pho

When considering a drink to accompany your Pho, **Vietnamese Iced Coffee (Ca Phe Sua Da)** comes highly recommended. This strong coffee is combined with sweetened condensed milk and ice, creating a creamy and refreshing beverage. Its bold flavor makes it an ideal companion to the hearty Pho, with the sweetness of the milk balancing the both savory and spicy notes of the broth. A sip of this traditional drink between spoonfuls of Pho resets your palate and enhances the overall dining experience.

Exploring the world of Pho beyond just the bowl can open up a new sensory delight. Each of the side dishes listed here offers a unique complement to the rich and aromatic flavors of Pho, creating a symphony of tastes and textures.
