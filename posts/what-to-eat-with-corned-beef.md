The good news is that there are many delicious choices to complement its mouthwatering taste. Here, we explore some classic and innovative food pairings that can make your corned beef meal unforgettable.

## **Mashed Potatoes**

The creamy texture of **mashed potatoes** melds beautifully with the robust flavor of corned beef.

For an added twist, try incorporating roasted garlic or a splash of cream into your mashed potatoes. This classic pairing is a guaranteed hit, whether served at a family gathering or a holiday feast.

## **Cabbage**

Cabbage is a traditional side dish for corned beef, making it a must-try pairing. When cooked, it softens and absorbs the juices from the beef, enhancing its flavor profile. You can prepare it in many ways, such as sautéed with onions, boiled, or even roasted to add a bit of texture. Its slight sweetness and crunch complement the savory corned beef perfectly, offering a well-rounded bite every time.

## **Carrots**

Adding **carrots** to your meal introduces a sweet and earthy flavor to the mix, which pairs wonderfully with the savory taste of corned beef. When cooked until tender, carrots not only provide a pop of color to your plate but also a delightful contrast in taste and texture. Roasting them with a hint of honey or brown sugar can further enhance their natural sweetness, giving you a delectable and nutritious side.

## **Bread or Rolls**

For those who love a good sandwich, thinly sliced or shredded corned beef on **fresh bread or rolls** is a treat you won't want to miss. A crusty roll or soft rye bread can provide a sturdy vehicle to hold the tender beef, accompanied by mustard or pickles to add a burst of flavor. Whether you’re making sandwiches for a casual lunch or crafting a more elaborate meal, bread offers endless possibilities for creativity.

## **Sauerkraut**

Sauerkraut, with its distinctive tang and crisp texture, pairs surprisingly well with corned beef. This fermented cabbage dish cuts through the richness of the meat, adding a refreshing and zesty element to your plate. Whether enjoyed warm or cold, sauerkraut’s acidity complements the beef’s robust character, creating a balanced and satisfying combination that's often seen in classic Reuben sandwiches.
