Whether you're whipping up a weekday dinner or treating yourself on a cozy weekend, pairing Salisbury Steak with the right sides can transform your meal into a culinary delight. Here are some delicious ideas to get you started.

## **Creamy Mashed Potatoes**

There's no better choice than **creamy mashed potatoes** to absorb the rich and flavorful gravy that comes with Salisbury Steak.

To make your mashed potatoes stand out, consider adding a hint of garlic or a sprinkle of parmesan cheese. This classic side creates a comforting pairing that feels like a warm embrace on a cool evening.

## **Roasted Vegetables**

For a dish that brings color and nutrition to your plate, opt for **roasted vegetables**. Root vegetables like carrots, parsnips, and sweet potatoes become wonderfully caramelized when roasted, providing a sweet counterpoint to the savory steak. Add a touch of rosemary or thyme to enhance the earthy flavors of the vegetables. This pairing not only adds a pop of color but also complements the heartiness of the steak perfectly.

Serving freshly baked rolls with a spread of softened butter takes your dining experience to the next level. Whether you purchase them or make them from scratch, the rolls are a staple side that can't be ignored.

## **Steamed Green Beans**

If you're looking for a lighter side, consider serving **steamed green beans**. Their crisp, fresh flavor provides a nice contrast to the richness of Salisbury Steak. Lightly steam the beans and toss them with a squeeze of lemon juice and a dash of salt for a refreshing zing. The bright notes of the green beans not only add variety to your meal but also lighten up the overall menu.

## **Herbed Rice Pilaf**

For a sophisticated touch, serve your Salisbury Steak with **herbed rice pilaf**. The fluffiness of the rice paired with aromatic herbs such as dill or parsley creates a delicate balance that enhances the flavors of the steak. A well-made pilaf, with its subtle layers of flavor, serves as a harmonious backdrop to the bold tastes of Salisbury Steak. It's a delightful pairing that can transform an ordinary dinner into an extraordinary one.

## **Bonus: Beverage Pairing**

When it comes to selecting the perfect **beverage pairing** for your meal, consider a full-bodied **red wine** like a Cabernet Sauvignon.

Additionally, if you prefer a non-alcoholic option, a glass of iced tea with a splash of lemon can be a refreshing complement to the meal, cutting through the richness of the dish effortlessly.
