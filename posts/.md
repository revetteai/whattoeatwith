Avocado toast has taken the culinary world by storm, delighting palates with its creamy texture and mild flavor. While delicious on its own, pairing it with the right accompaniments can elevate your avocado toast experience from simple to sublime. Whether you're enjoying it for breakfast, lunch, or a snack, choosing complementary foods can enhance its taste, provide nutritional balance, and make your meal more satisfying.

## **Eggs**

The classic combination of **avocado toast with eggs** is a winner. Whether poached, scrambled, or fried, eggs add a protein punch and a rich, savory contrast to the creamy avocado. The runny yolk of a poached or soft-boiled egg can create a delightful sauce for the toast, while scrambled eggs offer a fluffy texture. Plus, the proteins in the eggs provide a satiating balance to the healthy fats from the avocado.

## **Smoked Salmon**

For those who crave a touch of elegance with their meal, **smoked salmon** is an excellent choice. The salty and slightly smoky flavors of the salmon complement the creamy, rich avocado beautifully. This pairing not only adds an umami depth but also an impressive serving of omega-3 fatty acids, making it a nutritious option for breakfast or brunch. Add a sprinkle of capers or a few slices of red onion for an extra burst of flavor.

## **Tomato Slices**

For a refreshing twist, add vibrant **tomato slices** to your avocado toast. The juicy, sweet acidity of ripe tomatoes provides a fresh contrast to the smoothness of the avocado. This combination not only looks appealing with its array of colors but also enhances the avocado toast with additional vitamins and antioxidants. For a fuller flavor profile, you can drizzle a bit of balsamic glaze over the top.

## **Radish Slices**

If you're looking for a bit of crunch and slight peppery kick, consider topping your avocado toast with **radish slices**. The crisp texture and subtle spice of radishes offer an unexpected twist, making each bite exciting and flavorful. The visual appeal of the bright red skin against the green avocado base also makes for an Instagram-worthy plate. Radishes are low in calories and high in vitamin C, making them a healthful addition to your meal.

## **Bacon**

For those who enjoy a robust, savory flavor, **bacon** is an irresistible choice to pair with avocado toast. The crispiness and smoky taste of bacon add a delectable contrast to the creamy avocado. While bacon is generally higher in fat and sodium, using a moderate amount can add just the right level of indulgence without overwhelming the health benefits of the meal. Consider turkey bacon for a leaner alternative.

## Bonus: Beverage Pairing

For an ideal beverage pairing with avocado toast, consider a glass of **freshly squeezed orange juice**. The natural sweetness and acidity of the orange juice complement the creamy texture and mild flavor of the avocado, creating a refreshing balance. Additionally, the vitamin C in the juice aids in the absorption of iron from the bread and other ingredients, making this combination as beneficial as it is delicious.
