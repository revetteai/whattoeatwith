## Toast

If you're looking for a heartier option, try spreading peanut butter on toast. The warm and toasty bread pairs well with the smooth and nutty flavor of peanut butter. You can also add some sliced bananas or apples on top for an extra boost of flavor and nutrients.

For those with a sweet tooth, chocolate and peanut butter is a match made in heaven. Whether it's in the form of a peanut butter cup or a chocolate spread, the combination of these two flavors is irresistible.
