Beets are a delicious and nutritious root vegetable that can add a vibrant color and earthy flavor to your meals. Whether you're roasting them to perfection or slicing them thin in a salad, beets can be a versatile addition to your culinary repertoire. But to truly elevate your beet dishes, it's essential to know what ingredients harmonize best with beets. In this blog post, we will explore some delicious foods and a special beverage you can pair with beets to enhance their natural flavors.

## **Goat Cheese**

The creamy and tangy profile of **goat cheese** makes it an exceptional companion to the sweet earthiness of beets. Whether you’re serving a beet salad or preparing a luxurious beetroot risotto, goat cheese adds a layer of creaminess that balances the sharpness of the beet. Sprinkle crumbled goat cheese on roasted beets for a delightful texture contrast, or blend it into a dressing for a creamy, zesty finish.

## **Walnuts**

**Walnuts** are not only a nutritious choice but also a wonderful textural complement to soft, tender beets. Their rich, buttery taste provides a savory contrast to the sweet nature of beets. In salads or as a garnish on beetroot soup, toasted walnuts can introduce a delightful crunch and a nutty depth that elevates the overall dining experience.

## **Citrus Fruits**

The bright and refreshing acidity of **citrus fruits** like oranges or grapefruits can cut through the earthiness of beets with finesse. Adding segments of these fruits or a splash of citrus juice to your beet dishes can bring a new dimension of freshness and a burst of flavor. Try a beet and citrus salad with a light vinaigrette to enjoy a symphony of sweet, tangy, and earthy notes.

## **Arugula**

**Arugula**, with its peppery flavor profile, is a fantastic leafy partner for beets. The spicy bite of arugula provides a striking contrast to the sweetness of beets, creating a harmonious balance on the palate. Use arugula as the base for your beet salads and toss them together with a simple lemon dressing to highlight the robust flavors of both ingredients.

## **Feta Cheese**

For those who prefer a saltier cheese, **feta** is an excellent match for beets. Its crumbly texture and briny flavor can enhance the natural sweetness of beets, making it perfect for salads and roasted beet dishes. Crumble feta over freshly roasted beets or blend into a beet-based dip for a tangy twist that will please your taste buds.

## **Bonus: Beverage Pairing with Beets**

Pairing a drink with beets might not be the first thing that comes to mind, but a thoughtfully chosen beverage can complement your beet dishes beautifully. A **dry Rosé wine** is an excellent choice for its balance of fruitiness and crisp acidity. The subtle berry notes and refreshing finish keenly complement the earthy sweetness of beets. Alternatively, a freshly made beetroot juice with a splash of lime can make for a revitalizing non-alcoholic option that pairs splendidly with beet salads.

Exploring the world of flavors that pair well with beets can lead you to exciting culinary discoveries and enhance your dining experiences. Whether you choose to enjoy beets with creamy goat cheese, crunchy walnuts, or combine them with refreshing citrus, each pairing offers a unique enhancement to the naturally sweet and earthy taste of beets.
