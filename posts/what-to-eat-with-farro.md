Farro, an ancient grain with a nutty flavor and delightful chewy texture, is a versatile staple that deserves a spot in your pantry. Whether you're a seasoned chef or a home cook exploring new grains, pairing farro with the right ingredients can transform this simple grain into an extraordinary dish. From salads to warm bowls, farro is not only easy to prepare but also pairs beautifully with a variety of flavors and textures. Let's explore some incredible foods that can elevate your farro dishes to new culinary heights.

## **Roasted Vegetables**

Pairing farro with **roasted vegetables** is a classic choice that enhances both texture and flavor. Roasted root vegetables like carrots, sweet potatoes, and red onions bring a natural sweetness and caramelized note that complements farro’s earthy taste. Toss in some seasonal vegetables such as Brussels sprouts or bell peppers and finish with a sprinkle of fresh herbs like rosemary or thyme to create a wholesome and hearty meal. Roasted vegetables add color and nutrition, making the dish both visually appealing and nourishing.

## **Grilled Chicken**

For those who enjoy a more protein-rich meal, **grilled chicken** is an excellent companion for farro. The light, smoky flavor of grilled chicken pairs wonderfully with the nutty undertones of farro. Consider marinating the chicken in a blend of lemon juice, garlic, and herbs for a zesty flavor profile before grilling to perfection. Cut into slices and mix with farro for a satisfying and well-balanced meal, perfect for a family dinner or meal prep for the week.

## **Feta Cheese and Olives**

Mediterranean flavors like **feta cheese and olives** embrace farro’s versatility and offer a delicious, tangy twist. The saltiness of feta complements the subtle taste of farro, while briny olives add depth and complexity. Toss these with farro, include some diced cucumbers and cherry tomatoes, and drizzle with olive oil for a refreshing Mediterranean-inspired salad. This combination is ideal for a light lunch or as a side dish to grilled meats.

## **Mushrooms**

**Mushrooms**, with their rich umami flavor, enhance the earthiness of farro in a truly satisfying way. Sautéed mushrooms such as cremini, shiitake, or portobello can be seasoned with garlic and a touch of balsamic vinegar for an aromatic finish. This pairing works beautifully as a warm salad or a comforting risotto-style dish, adding a depth of flavor that is both luxurious and comforting.

## **Butternut Squash**

Pairing farro with **butternut squash** creates a symphony of flavors and textures that are perfect for fall and winter meals. The natural sweetness of butternut squash, enhanced by roasting, balances the slight nuttiness of farro. Add a dash of cinnamon or nutmeg while roasting to infuse a warm spiciness, or toss in some toasted nuts for crunch. This combination not only tastes divine but also delivers a vibrant splash of color to your dining table.

## **Bonus: Wine Pairing**

To elevate your farro dish, consider pairing it with a **light white wine** such as Pinot Grigio. The crisp, refreshing notes of Pinot Grigio complement farro’s nutty undertones without overwhelming its subtle flavors. Alternatively, for those who prefer red wine, a light-bodied red like Pinot Noir can accompany dishes with roasted vegetables or mushrooms, providing a balanced finish. Whether you opt for white or red, the right wine adds an elegant touch to your meal, enhancing the overall dining experience.

Each of these pairings adds a unique dimension to farro, making it an exciting grain to experiment with in your kitchen.
