Bagels are a beloved breakfast staple, known for their chewy texture and delightful flavor. But as versatile as they are, bagels truly shine when paired with the right complements. Whether you're a purist or a culinary adventurer, exploring the variety of toppings and sides can enhance your bagel experience. Dive into these delectable pairings that elevate your bagel from simple to spectacular.

## **Cream Cheese**

There's a reason why **cream cheese** is synonymous with bagels—it’s the perfect match. The smooth, creamy texture of cream cheese provides a delicious contrast to a bagel's dense chewiness. Opt for a classic plain cream cheese to keep things traditional, or explore flavored varieties like scallion, chive, or even jalapeño for a kick. This spread not only moistens the bagel but also complements its subtle flavors, making for a balanced bite.

## **Smoked Salmon**

Also known as **lox**, smoked salmon is a quintessential bagel companion. Popularized by New York City delicatessens, this savory and slightly salty fish pairs wonderfully with a slice of crispy bagel. Add a shmear of cream cheese, a few capers, thinly sliced red onions, and a sprinkle of dill to create an elegant open-faced sandwich. This combination offers a rich tapestry of flavors that is both satisfying and nutritious.

## **Avocado**

For those seeking a modern twist, **avocado** is a trendy and nutritious option. Rich in healthy fats and fiber, mashed avocado on a bagel can be a wholesome breakfast or snack. Enhance the avocado's subtle flavor with a squeeze of lemon juice, a pinch of salt, and a sprinkle of chili flakes. This vibrant, creamy topping is not only delicious but also Instagram-worthy, adding a contemporary flair to your bagel routine.

## **Nut Butter**

**Nut butter** such as almond, peanut, or cashew butter provides a hearty and protein-packed option for bagel pairings. Spread evenly over a toasted bagel, the rich, nutty flavors create a satisfying taste that both adults and children love. Top it with sliced bananas or a drizzle of honey for an extra touch of sweetness. This combination is perfect for a quick breakfast that will keep you energized throughout the day.

## **Eggs**

Eggs provide a versatile and protein-rich complement to any bagel. Whether you prefer a simple fried egg, scrambled eggs, or a more indulgent combination like an egg and cheese sandwich, the fluffy texture and rich flavor of eggs pair beautifully with the chewy backdrop of a bagel. This combo not only makes for a filling breakfast but can also be enjoyed at any time of the day, serving as a great option for brunch or a satisfying meal.

## Bonus: **Beverage Pairing**

Pair your bagel with a warm cup of **coffee** or **tea** to complete your meal. Coffee’s bold, robust flavors make it an ideal companion for both sweet and savory bagel toppings. The smooth, aromatic notes of a fine brew can highlight the subtleties of cream cheese or the richness of smoked salmon. Alternatively, a cup of herbal or black tea provides a gentle palate refresher, balancing the hearty nature of a nut butter or avocado-laden bagel. Whichever you choose, a warm drink will elevate your bagel experience, rounding it off beautifully.

Bagels are a canvas of culinary possibilities, where the only limit is your imagination.
