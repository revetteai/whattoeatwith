Amaranth, a nutrient-dense ancient grain, has been cherished for centuries across different cultures. Its mildly nutty flavor and versatility make it a delightful addition to any meal. But to truly unlock its potential, pairing amaranth with complementary foods can elevate its taste and nutritional profile. Whether you're a seasoned chef or a home cook experimenting in the kitchen, knowing what to mix with amaranth can lead to exciting culinary creations.

## **1. Quinoa**

Amaranth and **quinoa** are a nutritional powerhouse when combined. Both are high in protein, gluten-free, and packed with essential amino acids. Cooking amaranth with quinoa introduces a fun textural contrast, with the slight crunch of quinoa and the smoother feel of amaranth. A quinoa-amaranth salad, garnished with fresh parsley, chopped tomatoes, and a light vinaigrette, makes for a refreshing meal that's both energizing and satisfying.

## **2. Sweet Potatoes**

Another excellent match for amaranth is **sweet potatoes**. The earthy sweetness of sweet potatoes complements the nutty notes of amaranth perfectly. Try making a comforting sweet potato and amaranth porridge. Simply cook diced sweet potatoes with amaranth in almond milk and add a touch of cinnamon for warmth. This dish makes a hearty breakfast or a filling side that’s not only delicious but will also keep you full for hours.

## **3. Black Beans**

For a protein-packed meal, pair amaranth with **black beans**. This combination is especially useful for those on vegetarian or vegan diets, as it provides a complete protein source. The creamy texture of black beans balanced with the slight bite of amaranth creates a satisfying mouthfeel. Consider making a black bean and amaranth chili, loaded with spices and fresh cilantro for a flavorful twist.

## **4. Spinach**

Adding **spinach** to amaranth elevates any dish, making it both vibrant and nutritious. The mild taste of spinach doesn't overpower amaranth but adds a layer of freshness and color. For a light lunch, cook amaranth lightly seasoned and toss it with steamed spinach, lemon zest, and a sprinkle of feta cheese. This simple yet elegant dish celebrates the natural flavors while ticking off your nutrient needs.

## **5. Mushrooms**

**Mushrooms** and amaranth together create a savory, umami-rich combination. The robust flavors of mushrooms, whether you choose cremini, shiitake, or button, pair well with the subtle taste of amaranth. Use this duo as a filling in stuffed bell peppers or as a base for a hearty risotto. The depth of flavor from the mushrooms will enhance the mild, nutty tones of amaranth, providing comfort with every bite.

## **Bonus: Green Tea**

Pairing a beverage with amaranth might not immediately come to mind, but **green tea** is a perfect match. Green tea’s slightly bitter and floral notes complement the nutty flavor of amaranth without overpowering it. This duo is wonderful for a brunch or a light lunch. The antioxidants in green tea further enhance the nutritional benefits, making your amaranth dish not only tasty but also healthy. Enjoy green tea hot or iced depending on the season, and appreciate the harmony it creates with your meal.

Embracing amaranth in your cooking is not just about enjoying a healthier lifestyle but also about discovering new flavor combinations. The versatility of amaranth and its ability to blend seamlessly with both classic and innovative pairings make it a true culinary gem.
