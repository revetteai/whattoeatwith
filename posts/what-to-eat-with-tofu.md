Tofu, also known as bean curd, is a versatile and protein-rich ingredient that is a staple in many plant-based diets. While it may be delicious on its own, pairing it with other foods can take it to the next level. Here are some ideas for what to eat with tofu to enhance its flavor and create a well-rounded meal.

## 1. Stir-Fried Vegetables

Tofu and stir-fried vegetables are a classic combination in Asian cuisine. The soft and silky texture of tofu pairs well with the crunchiness of stir-fried vegetables. Plus, the vegetables add a variety of flavors and textures to the dish, making it a well-balanced meal. Add some soy sauce, garlic, and ginger for an extra burst of flavor.

## 2. Brown Rice

Tofu and brown rice make a nutritious and filling duo. The nutty flavor of brown rice complements the mild taste of tofu, making it a great base for a meal. Brown rice is also a good source of fiber and essential nutrients, making it a healthier alternative to white rice.

## 3. Avocado

Avocado may not be the first thing that comes to mind when thinking about what to eat with tofu, but it's a surprisingly delicious pairing. The creamy and rich texture of avocado complements the softness of tofu, creating a satisfying and nutritious meal. You can combine them in a salad, on toast, or in a wrap for a quick and easy meal.

## 4. Quinoa

Quinoa is another excellent option to pair with tofu. This gluten-free grain is a complete protein, meaning it contains all nine essential amino acids. Combining it with tofu, which is also a complete protein, makes for a protein-packed meal. Quinoa's nutty flavor adds depth to the dish, and its fluffy texture pairs well with the softness of tofu.

## 5. Peanut Sauce

Peanut sauce is a flavorful and creamy condiment that goes well with tofu. The peanut butter adds richness, while the soy sauce and sesame oil add a savory and umami flavor. You can use it as a dipping sauce or toss tofu and vegetables in it for a delicious and satisfying stir-fry.

In conclusion, tofu is a versatile ingredient that can be paired with a variety of foods to create a well-rounded and delicious meal. Whether you're looking for a quick and easy lunch or a hearty dinner, these pairings will elevate your tofu
