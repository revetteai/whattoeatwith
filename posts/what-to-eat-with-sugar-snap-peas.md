The herbs in the cheese highlight the natural sweetness of the peas, creating a harmony of flavors that is hard to resist.

## **Lemon Herb Roasted Chicken**

Sugar snap peas make a great side for **lemon herb roasted chicken**. The brightness of lemon and herbs pairs excellently with the lightly sweet snap peas' flavor.

The crunch of the sugar snap peas provides a nice contrast to the tender, juicy chicken.

## **Quinoa Salad**

Incorporate sugar snap peas into a **quinoa salad** for a nutritious and colorful dish. The nuttiness of quinoa combined with the crisp sweetness of the peas makes for a satisfying duo. Add ingredients like cherry tomatoes, feta cheese, and a light vinaigrette to bring out the flavor of the peas. This pairing is perfect for a light lunch or as a side dish at a summer gathering.

## **Grilled Salmon**

Consider **grilled salmon** for a protein-packed, flavorful pairing. The rich, oily nature of salmon enhances the sweetness of the snap peas without overpowering them.
