### What to Eat With Stuffing

Stuffing is a beloved dish often associated with festive occasions and comforting meals. While it's a star on its own, pairing it with the right accompaniments can elevate your dining experience. Whether you're looking to complement its flavors or add variety to your plate, knowing what to eat with stuffing can make all the difference.

## **Roasted Turkey**

A classic and timeless pairing, **roasted turkey** and stuffing are often considered inseparable. The savory and herbaceous flavors of stuffing balance perfectly with the juicy, tender meat of a golden-brown turkey. This duo creates a festive atmosphere, reminiscent of holiday feasts. The flavors meld together beautifully, resulting in a harmonious bite every time. Whether it's for a special occasion or a simple family dinner, turkey and stuffing deliver a comforting culinary experience.

## **Mashed Potatoes**

If you're looking for a classic starchy counterpart, **mashed potatoes** are a top choice. The creamy texture of mashed potatoes provides a pleasant contrast to the crumbly consistency of stuffing. Their mild flavor also allows the herbs and spices in the stuffing to shine. A drizzle of gravy over both completes the trifecta of comfort food. This combination is satisfying and is sure to please guests of all ages.

## **Roasted Vegetables**

For a healthy and colorful addition, consider **roasted vegetables**. Caramelized carrots, parsnips, and Brussels sprouts bring a natural sweetness and a variety of textures. The slight char from roasting adds a depth of flavor that complements the herbs in the stuffing. Together, they create a vibrant and well-rounded meal. This pairing not only tastes great but also adds nutritional balance to your plate.

## **Cranberry Sauce**

Add a touch of tart sweetness with **cranberry sauce**. This tangy side is a traditional companion to stuffing, offering a refreshing contrast to its savory notes. The bright, bold flavor of cranberries enhances the rich taste of stuffing, creating a delightful sweet-sour balance. This pairing can also visually brighten your plate, appealing to both the eye and the palate.

## **Gravy**

To add moisture and extra flavor, top your stuffing with rich **gravy**. This classic accompaniment can transform even the simplest meal into a feast. Gravy's savory warmth deepens the flavors of stuffing, enhancing its aromatic ingredients. Using gravy made from turkey drippings can create a seamless flavor profile that ties the entire meal together. Whether it's a simple weeknight dinner or a grand holiday spread, gravy is the ultimate sidekick for stuffing.

## Bonus: **Wine Pairing**

For a beverage that complements the complexity of stuffing, consider a **Chardonnay**. This full-bodied white wine offers rich, creamy notes with hints of vanilla and oak that pair well with the herbs and spices in stuffing. Its moderate acidity cuts through the richness, refreshing your palate between bites. Whether you prefer it buttery or oaked, Chardonnay provides an elegant yet approachable pairing for your next meal with stuffing.

The delightful flavors of stuffing are truly enhanced when paired with the right foods and beverages. Whether you're sticking to traditional pairings like turkey or exploring something new with roasted vegetables or cranberry sauce, there's a combination to satisfy every palate. Don't forget the perfect glass of Chardonnay to accentuate those delicious flavors.
